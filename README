This is the software for the "Fotosyntese Festival" pinball machine. It
consists of two programs: "game" and "videomode". This release does not include
lamp shows, graphics, music or sound effects. It is provided purely in the hope
that you may learn from the code.

This source code is released under the ISC licence, so that you can use parts
of this package that you find useful, without forcing you to release your
derived source code to the public. See LICENCE for details.

If you have any questions, or want to know more about this machine, see the
thread at the PinballControllers.com forum:

game
----

The "game" directory contains a Python program that controls most of the
pinball machine's features:

game.py contains the game logic.

midi.py is a lamp show MIDI sequencer.

net.py is a module for communicating with the "videomode" program.

export_tracks.py and import_tracks.py are for converting between human-editable
text files, and the format that midi.py uses.

videomode
---------

The "videomode" directory contains a C program that renders the animations.
There are two main files, vc_main.c and x11_main.c. Autoconf should detect
whether you are running on a Raspberry Pi. If it finds bcm_host.h, it assumes
you are, and selects vc_main.c, otherwise, it assumes you're running Linux with
X11 and GLX, and selects x11_main.c.

To compile:

    $ autoreconf -f -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make


There is also a script, mkanims.py, which converts the (missing) PNG files into
".vma" animation files.

The machine was made by:
Tormod Pettersen: Project lead, sound, mechanics 
Martin Stensgård: Programming, electronics
Zoltán Sághy: Graphics, animations
